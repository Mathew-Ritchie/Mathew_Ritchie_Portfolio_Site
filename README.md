# Mathew_Ritchie_Portfolio_site

## About

This is a portfolio site that I have created for myself. I have utillised React as a framework with Javascript to build the UI. I have used an external CSS method where I have created individual css files for most of the components. Originally as the site only showcased three of my projects, I had built seperate pages for each of them. As I have now added more projects, I have decided to make a projectData.js which containes a ProjectData object. this object gets exported to a projectsPage which utilises useParams(), a react-router hook, and dynamic routing to display the correct project details on the user interface.
